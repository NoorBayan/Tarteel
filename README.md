# Tarteel
Tarteel is an AI-powered, multilingual Quranic learning project designed for children. The system utilizes advanced AI techniques to facilitate interactive Quranic learning. The process begins with a Quranic reciter reading an Ayah (verse) in Arabic, which is then repeated by one child in Arabic. Following this, another child repeats the same Ayah in a foreign language, enabling children to learn and understand the Quran in both Arabic and a second language. This project aims to provide an engaging and effective way for children to learn Quranic verses while enhancing their linguistic skills across multiple languages.
